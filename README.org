#+title: Github Action for Common Lisp

This Action:

- Installs a Common Lisp compiler of your choice (SBCL, ECL, or ABCL).
- Uses the [[https://github.com/fosskers/vend][vend]] tool to fetch dependencies.
- Enables trivial testing of your project.
- Caches your build artifacts (FASL files).

* Usage

** Basics

Create a =.github/workflows/cl.yaml= file with the following contents:

#+begin_src yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Unit Tests
    steps:
      - name: Clone the Project
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Common Lisp
        uses: fosskers/common-lisp@v1

      - name: Test
        run: |
          vend test
#+end_src

Your dependencies will be automatically fetched by =vend=, so you're free to do
what you please in subseqent steps. In the example here, we simply call =vend test=,
which returns the proper error code to fail the job if any tests failed.

** Compiler Selection

By default =vend= operates with SBCL, but we can customize this:

#+begin_src yaml
- name: Install Vend
  uses: fosskers/common-lisp@v1
  with:
    compiler: ecl
#+end_src

then subsequent steps will have ECL available to them:

#+begin_src yaml
- name: Test
  run: |
    vend test ecl
#+end_src
